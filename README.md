# History Insights Extension using Chrome Built-in AI (Gemini Nano API's)

## Usage
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`
- Run 'npm run dev'
- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer Mode
- Click on Load Unpacked and select the `dist` folder
- You should now see the extension in the Extensions tab and accessing the history page should redirect automatically to the Insight History page

Currently, this is the only way to use the extension. The extension is not yet available in the Chrome Web Store or in a packed zip file.
Updates for this are coming soon.
